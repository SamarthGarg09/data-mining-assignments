## DM Lab 3
Consider the two datasets used in Lab 2. Do the following questions:

i. Normalize all columns to lie between -1 and 1 using mu-sigma normalisation.

ii. Perform k-means clustering using 10 clusters

iii. Draw a plot of the intra-class distance from the cluster center v/s the number of clusters. Using the same plot suggest the ideal number of clusters using knee analysis. 

iv. Iteratively drop the features with the lowest variation till there is only 1 feature. Repeat (iii) for different number of features. 

v. Using PCA reduce the number of features. Repeat (iii) for different number of features.

vii. Using (iii) identify the clusters with a very small membership (very few elements in the cluster). Delete all data of that cluster, and repeat the solution of (iii) with the reduced data.

viii. Using any image editor, write your full name using black ink with a white background and save it as an image. Cluster all black points using k-means clustering and plot the cluster centers. Connect every cluster head to the c-closest cluster heads by an undirected edge. Plot the graph hence produced for different values of k and c.
